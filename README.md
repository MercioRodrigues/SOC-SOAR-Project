# SOC-SOAR-Project

## Objective


The objective of this project was to set up and configure a Security Operations Center (SOC) using Wazuh and TheHive for monitoring and responding to security incidents. Using Shuffle, the project involved creating a scalable, automated security monitoring system capable of detecting and responding to threats.


### Skills Learned


- Setting up and configuring cloud-based security tools.
- Installing and managing Wazuh for threat detection.
- Installing and managing TheHive for case management.
- Configuring Sysmon on Windows machines and integrating it with Wazuh for enhanced logging and detection.
- Creating custom alerts and rules in Wazuh.
- Implementing a SOAR by automating security workflows with Shuffle.
- Integrating external APIs like VirusTotal for threat intelligence enrichment.
- Utilizing Linux command-line tools for system administration and configuration management.
- Configuration of data storage and indexing engines (Cassandra, Elasticsearch).
- Cyber threat intelligence and response automation
